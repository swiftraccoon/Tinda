# Tinda

## Problem Statement
Tinder is full of bots. It's also full of people who just aren't going to
respond for whatever is reason. (I'm sure there's more I may automate) I would
like to make it such that I do not have to waste my time on the aforementioned
scenarios. Why not learn some about a programming language or two, and a smidge
of machine learning as well?
